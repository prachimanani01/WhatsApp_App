# WhatsApp UI 

## `Introduction`

Welcome to the WhatsApp UI Clone project! This repository contains a fully functional clone of the WhatsApp user interface, developed using the Flutter framework. The primary aim of this project is educational, providing an opportunity to explore and understand the development of complex user interfaces using Flutter.

### `Why Create a WhatsApp ?`

WhatsApp is one of the most widely used messaging applications globally, known for its clean and intuitive interface. By recreating the WhatsApp UI, developers can gain valuable insights into:

- **UI Design**: Learning how to build complex and responsive layouts using Flutter.
- **State Management**: Understanding how to manage the state of an application efficiently.
- **Navigation**: Implementing seamless navigation between different screens.
- **Custom Widgets**: Creating reusable and modular widgets to maintain clean code.

This project serves as a practical exercise for Flutter developers to deepen their understanding of these concepts and improve their development skills.

### `Project Features`

- **Chats Page**: Displays a list of conversations with contacts. Each chat tile includes the contact's name, profile picture, last message, and the timestamp of the last message. Users can navigate to individual chat screens from here.
- **Status Page**: Shows the status updates of your contacts, similar to the stories feature in other social media applications. Each status tile displays the contact's name and profile picture, and users can view the full status by tapping on the tile.
- **Calls Page**: Lists recent call history, including incoming, outgoing, and missed calls. Each call tile displays the contact's name, profile picture, and the timestamp of the call. Users can initiate calls from this screen.
